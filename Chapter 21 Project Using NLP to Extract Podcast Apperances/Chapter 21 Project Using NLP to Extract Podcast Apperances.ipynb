Kamasi is a saxophonist and composer. In the studio, he\\'s played sax and arranged for hitmakers like Kendrick Lamar, Ryan Adams, Snoop Dogg - and that\\'s just naming a handful. On his own, he\\'s a visionary bandleader with over half a dozen solo records to his name.   He broke through in 2015, with his three hour long instant classic \"The Epic\" - a record that found its way to a bunch of top ten lists and renewed a fiery debate in the music world: can a guy like Kamasi, not yet 40, revive jazz and turn it into a young person\\'s game again? He and Jesse talk about his time playing sax in bands, as a composer and bandleader, and his nearly unbeatable Street Fighter II skills.   We\\'ll close out this week\\'s show with a treat: a short story from the one and only Simon Rich! He\\'s been a writer for SNL, the New Yorker and much more.

He was kind of an impressions guy - he did a mean Vincent Price. But his most famous character was Stefon, from Weekend Update. You remember Stefon, right? He left the show in 2013 and took up acting - he stars alongside Fred Armisen on IFC's Documentary Now! His latest project is a TV show called Barry, out now on HBO. Hader stars as the show's title character, Barry Berkman. Barry's an ex-marine, turned low rent hitman in Ohio, turned aspiring actor in Los Angeles.   And finally, Van Morrison doesn't really like to perform live, but that didn't stop him from making a perfect live album.

He broke though when he starred as Martin Luther King in Selma, the Oscar nominated biopic.  Now, he's starring in Gringo, a new THC-tinged action comedy. Oyelowo talks about his love of acting, being nearly killed by Tom Cruise in a car and his terrific bit part on HBO's the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency.   Then, Heather Graham. You probably know her for her iconic roles in Boogie Nights, Swingers, Drugstore Cowboy and more. These days she's working behind the camera. She directed and wrote Half Magic - a comedy about love, sexism, spirituality, and Hollywood.   Finally, for this week's outshot: need a gritty detective movie with heart?
